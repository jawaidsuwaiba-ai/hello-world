# Closed-Won Revenue Analysis by Lead Source

## Project Overview
This project analyzes closed-won opportunities by lead source and company size to provide actionable insights for marketing strategy.

## Business Problem
Which lead sources generate the highest revenue for different company segments (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)?

## Methodology
- Filtered opportunities to include only 'Won' deals
- Linked Leads with Opportunities on `lead_id`
- Created pivot tables to summarize total and average deal values
- Calculated % contribution of each lead source
- Segmented results by `company_size`

## Key Insights
- Event-driven leads contribute **44% of total Enterprise revenue** — high priority for Enterprise marketing
- Website leads are more effective for **SMB revenue**
- Paid Ads and Referrals contribute moderately (~25% each)
- Average deal value shows **Events win in both volume and revenue per deal**

## Recommendation
Focus marketing campaigns based on channel effectiveness per company segment, optimize ROI on Paid Ads, and increase event-driven campaigns for Enterprise accounts.
